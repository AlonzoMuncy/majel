{
    "PERFECT OPPORTUNITY": "Must be declared before a roll. A point of Determination may be spent to grant the character a single bonus d20. This bonus d20 differs from most in that it is considered to have already rolled a 1, and thus generates two successes automatically. The normal limit of additional d20s bought for a Task still applies.",
    "MOMENT OF INSPIRATION": "A point of Determination may be spent to re-roll all the characterâ€™s dice in their dice pool.",
    "SURGE OF ACTIVITY": "The character may immediately perform another Task as soon as this one has been resolved. This is most useful in combat or other situations where the character is under pressure and cannot normally attempt two consecutive Tasks.",
    "MAKE IT SO": "The character immediately creates an Advantage that applies to the current scene."
